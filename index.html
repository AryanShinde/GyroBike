            Bikes are mostly used for transportation within the same city
            and these are the most widely used and preferred way for
            transportation for short distance movement. There seems to
            be more scope for development in the field of Modeling and
            dynamics of bikes.
            A gyrocar is a two-wheeled automobile.
            The difference between a bicycle or motorcycle and a gyrocar is that in a bike, dynamic balance is provided
            by the rider, and in some cases by the geometry and mass distribution of the bike itself,
            and the gyroscopic effects from the wheels.
            Steering a motorcycle is done
            by precessing the front wheel. In a gyrocar, balance was provided by
            one or more gyroscopes, and in one example, connected to
            two pendulums by a rack and pinion.

            The stabilization of the vehicle is guaranteed by a set of 3 gyroscopes that are controlled by a
            microprocessor.

            The gyroscopes are fixed on a double cardan joint.

            According to Beghins theorem the gyroscopic effect creates an anti-roll couple that is the vectorial product
            of the cynetic moment of a spinning-top by the speedvector of the steering-lock of these according to an
            axis that is perpendicular to this last one (steering-lock of set B of the design).

            The appended picture shows the anti-roll vector and its trajectory when the gyroscope is turned.
